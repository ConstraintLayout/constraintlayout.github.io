Software Engineer and Google Developer Expert, I brew tasty code for passion (and  at JetBrains to make a living). Formerly working on Android at Novoda, and in industrial automation, I have been doing Android development since 2009. Used to be a Mechatronics Engineering student, with a past history of guerrilla videomaking.
